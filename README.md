A program to analyse player's progression in cuphead 

When playing cuphead, players usually encounter a death screen. A "progressbar" appears, with cuphead's position representing his progress.

This program aim to retrieve with computer vision player's progress.
It takes a screenshot, analyses it and returns the progress percentage.

The programm is still slow (3s) and can't sometimes find the actual progress. But it works most of the time
