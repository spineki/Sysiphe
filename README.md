A program to analyse player progression in cuphead 

When playing cuphead, players usually encounter a death screen. A "progressbar" appears, with cuphead's position representing his position.

This program aim to retrieve with computer vision player's progression.
It takes a screenshot, analyse it and return the progression percentage.

The programm is still slow (3s) and can't sometimes find the actual progression. But it works most of the time
